// Functions-2: 
// JS assignment: 
// 1. Write a JavaScript function that generates a string id (specified length) of random characters. har list = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789" 
// Example - 1: input=4 => output="A8Sf" 
// Example - 2: input=8=> output="29SaBfgu' 


function name(params) {
    
}


// JS assignment: 
// 2. Write a function to find the area and perimeter of a Circle Perimeter is 2*pi*rad Area is pi*radA2 
// Example - 1: input= 10 => output="Perimeter: 62.83, Area: 314.15" 
// Example - 2: input= 15 => output="Perimeter: 94.94, Area: 706.84" 






// JS assignment: 
// 3. Write a function to find the count of a specific letter in a string 
// Example: input=("Connect",c) => output=2 
// Example: input=("first person",c) => output=2 





// JS assignment: 
// 3. Write a JavaScript function to extract a specified number of characters from a string. 
// Example: input=func("Clarusway",6) => output="Clarus" 





// JS assignment: 
// 4. Develop a guessing game. Randomly generate a number between 0-100. Ask the user to guess that number. The user should have 5 chance to guess the number. If the number entered by the user: is greater than the random number then warn user to decrease, is less than the random number then warn user to increase, is equal to the random number then congratulate the user and tell in how many guesses were used to find the number If user can't find the number in 5 guess then game is lost and display the random number. 
// Hint: you can use this code to generate random number 0-100 const winingNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
